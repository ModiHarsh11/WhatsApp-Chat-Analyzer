# WhatsApp-Chat-Analyzer
This WhatsApp Chat Analyzer is a Python-based project I developed during my Python learning journey to explore text analysis and data visualization. It provides insightful analytics on WhatsApp chat histories by processing a .txt file exported from WhatsApp.

How It Works:
1. Upload a Chat File – The user provides a .txt file containing the chat history.
2. View & Download Data – The tool displays the raw chat data and allows the user to download it.
3. Chat Analysis – Generates various statistics and visual insights, including:
-> Total messages, words, and media shared
-> Most active participants
-> Daily and monthly activity trends
-> Commonly used words and emojis

Tech Stack:
-> Python – Backend logic and data processing
-> Streamlit – Interactive UI for user input and visualization

This project helped me understand text data processing and UI integration using Streamlit, making it a great hands-on experience with Python and data analytics.
